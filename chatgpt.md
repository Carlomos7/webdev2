# ChatGPT Example Prompts



**While ChatGPT is a powerful tool for answering questions and providing explanations, please remember it's an artificial intelligence model developed by OpenAI and not a human expert. It's trained on a diverse range of internet text, but it doesn't know everything and may not always provide accurate or complete information.**

If you notice an answer from ChatGPT that doesn't seem right or doesn't make sense, don't hesitate to ask for clarification, double-check the information using other resources, or ask your instructor or peers. It's all part of the learning process! 

Also, keep in mind that as of September 2021, ChatGPT has not been trained with information or updates about technology or programming languages released after this date.

If you want to learn more about the tools and technologies we're using in this assignment, ChatGPT is here to help! Here are some suggested prompts:

1. "Can you help me understand what a Flask web framework is and why it's important in this project?"
2. "Could you explain the structure of a JSON file? How do I fill in my details in the `resume.json` file?"
3. "What does a virtual environment do and why do we need it for this project?"
4. "Can you guide me through the process of activating the virtual environment?"
5. "I'm not sure how to install the required packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`. Can you explain what this command does?"
6. "I've run the Flask application but I'm not seeing anything when I navigate to `http://localhost:5000/`. What could be the issue?"
7. "Can you explain the concept of testing in web development? Why are we using Pytest in this project?"
8. "One of the Pytest tests failed. How can I understand the error message and debug this?"
9. "I'm having trouble understanding Git and GitHub. Can you provide a brief explanation or point me towards some resources?"
10. "I want to make sure my `resume.json` is formatted correctly. Could you provide a sample JSON object for reference?"
